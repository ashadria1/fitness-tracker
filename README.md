## Description
üîç For this project, I have created a workout tracker using NoSQL. This project requires a user to create a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema, and handle routes with Express.  To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application.

## Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view, create, and track daily workouts.  I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.  I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.  If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

* Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

* Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

* View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

* View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.


## Installation
üíæ 
* A mongodb server is required to function properly. Either set the MONGODB_URI environment variable or modify the connection uri in server.js to your mongodb server.
* clone the repo to your local machine
* `cd project_dir`
* `npm install`

## Usage
üíª `npm start`
